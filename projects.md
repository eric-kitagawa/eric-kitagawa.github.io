# Radien <img src="/assets/images/radien-logo.png" alt="Radien Prototype Dashboard" width="60">
*Bridging the gap between designers and engineers using AI-driven tools*

Radien is a software startup concept that provides front-end developers with analytics and automation tools to optimize user interfaces by identifying inefficiencies and dead code. Its goal is to help teams better manage and scale design systems across platforms and organizations.  

---

## Mission  

Our task was to research design system pain points for front-end engineers through direct user interviews. We wanted to better understand how design systems were being used across organizations and where developers most often felt blocked or frustrated.  

---

## Process & Insights  

Our interviews revealed a clear pattern: developers often lacked visibility into their design systems. Many weren’t sure which components already existed, leading them to rebuild features unnecessarily or create redundant code. The absence of clear, up-to-date documentation only amplified the problem, making it difficult for teams to stay aligned and efficient.  

This lack of information became the central problem Radien set out to address.

---

## Solution  

Based on our research, we defined three core goals for Radien:  

**Inform** – Give developers visibility into existing components, documentation, and adherence metrics.  
**Recover** – Help engineers quickly spot and resolve redundancies, responsiveness issues, or missing documentation.  
**Prevent** – Provide guardrails, like AI-powered suggestions, to stop duplicate or undocumented code from being introduced in the first place.  

---

## Prototype  

In our **Figma prototype**, these goals became specific features:  

- A dashboard view showing documentation coverage, responsiveness, and design adherence percentages.    
- An **AI-powered search bar** inside the IDE, helping developers find existing, properly documented components instead of recreating them.

## Reflection  

Designing Radien’s developer tools gave me a clearer perspective on the relationship between designers and engineers. I started to see how closely those roles are connected and how much smoother collaboration can be when the right tools are in place. What stood out to me is that well‑designed user interfaces aren’t just about polish or aesthetics — they can actively guide developers, reduce confusion, and even shape better coding practices.

This project showed me that design has the power to do more than just make things look good; it can become a bridge that helps engineers work faster, stay aligned, and feel more confident in what they’re building. It made me realize the real value of thoughtful UX is in how it improves the day‑to‑day reality of the people using it.
