      </h2>
      <p className="py-[5px]">
        Hello! I'm a third-year computer science student at Northeastern University.
        My background is primarily in full stack development. I take pride in building
        software that is functional, well-designed, and future-proof.
      </p>
      <p className="py-[5px]">
        At Northeastern, I'm part of Generate Product Development, a student-run 
        organization that builds production-ready software applications for
        Northeastern startups. I'm currently building CineCircle, a feature-rich movie
        review app that's the lovechild of apps like Letterboxd, Reddit, and Twitter. 
      </p>
      <p className="py-[5px] font-extrabold">
        I'm actively searching for software engineering internships for both Spring
        and Summer 2026!
